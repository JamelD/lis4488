### Assignments

*Assignment Links:*
1. [Lab Assignments README.md](labs/README.md "My Lab Assignments README.md file")
    - These labs are tightly integrated with the topics discussed in class: typically readings are assigned, concepts are discussed in-class (with some demonstration), and then students apply the concepts in lab activities. For each lab, students will need to submit pre-defined deliverables.

2. [Buildout Project README.md](buildout-project/README.md "My Buildout Project README.md file")
    - Identifying one or more unmet needs (e.g. end-user or technical) and applying these concepts to research, design, plan, build, and operate a process and/or subsystem to address that unmet need.

3. [Design Project README.md](design-project/README.md "My Design Project README.md file")
    - As a network administrator, you are in on the ground floor with Acme, which started as a home business selling a variety of technical widgets to a diverse customer base.
    - Again, at this time, the owner is adamant about Acme owning as much as its own infrastructure as it can –outsourcing may be a future option, but for now the owner wants all applications –including accounting and sales, research and development, telephony, messaging, and collaboration –hosted completely in-house.git s
    - The final paper and presentation will consist of the following:
        1. Restatement and summarization of the business problem addressed
        2. A logical diagram of your designed network, including subnets and servers –with narrative
        3. A physical diagram of your designed network, including routers, switches, firewalls, and servers
        4. A detail diagram of your server room(s) –with narrative
        5. A manifest of components needed to build the system you designed

# LIS 4488 - Network Administration

### Lab 10: Team Buildout Implementation I

#### Objectives
The objective of the lab is to begin the transition from student network administrators largely following lab scripts, to working and autonomous network administrators. <!-- The persons with whom you have conducted all of the previous labs will continue to be responsible for ensuring that the persons within that team’s Organizational Unit (OU) remain able to get work done using the user accounts and computers within that OU. In this regard, you and your former lab teammates will represent end-users on this system, and these persons will place demands and expectations upon the Buildout Teams that will be performing other administrative functions across an entire enterprise that happens to contain your former team’s OU, users, and computers. One demand and expectation might be, quite reasonably, that no Buildout Team perform any action that renders you and your fellow users unable to perform the work that they need to get done, e.g. corrupting the Active Directory beyond use, recognition, and recovery. -->

This mission is to assume a portion of the myriad processes and functions required to effectively, efficiently, and securely administer a real-world computer network: some of these processes were discussed in the previous Buildout Project Kickoff Meeting. You will form a team to carry out this mission, and that team will conduct research, read technical materials and acquire skills, collaborate and coordinate with other teams, write procedures and/or install and configure systems, and do whatever else is necessary to carry out your team’s mission.

As subsystem and process administrators, you will also be held accountable to the end-users in the class.
